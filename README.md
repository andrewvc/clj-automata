# CLJ Automata

A simple visualization tool for elementary cellular automata. 
This project is mostly intended to help others learn clojure.

There's a TON of documentation, both high and low-level, in the code. Students should read that, not this. So, please read [clj-automata/core.clj](https://github.com/andrewvc/clj-automata/blob/master/src/clj_automata/core.clj).

For more info on elementary cellular automata, please visit [the wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton).

## Usage

lein run RULE_NUMBER

Here's are some examples:

`lein run 22`
